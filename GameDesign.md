Game Design Document

My game name is 'Rok's Volley Pong'. I named like this because it is based on 'Pong'.

Rok is my character's name. He has googly eyes.

Blue Rok and red Rok fight each other using ball with the googly eyes.
If the ball hits the opposite side of your floor, you'll get the point.
This game is 5 points match.

Player can choose between single play and play for 2 people.
Single_Player & Blue Rok will use 'A' = 'go Left', 'D' = 'go Right', 'W' = 'Jump'
Red Rok will use 'LEFT_ARROW' = 'go Left', 'RIGHT_ARROW' = 'go Right', 'UP_ARROW' = 'Jump'.
When Rok meets the ball it will bounce.
Players can check their score in the upper side of the screen.
Player can change background color in the options.
If the player wins it will have an win effect.
If the player loses it will have an lose effect.





Players eyes are googly eyes and the ball has googly eyes too.
